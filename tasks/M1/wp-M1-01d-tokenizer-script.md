# wp:M1-01d — ScriptData state family

## Goal
ScriptData + 14 sub-states including the double-escape gymnastics (the
inner-HTML-of-`<script>` corner case).

## Acceptance
html5lib cases targeting `<script>` content pass; `</script>` only
terminates the element when not inside an escape.

## Handoff log
- 2026-05-11T15:20Z — created.
- 2026-05-11T16:02Z — claimed by agent-copilot-gpt-5.5 in sibling worktree `../starling-wp-M1-01d-tokenizer-script`.
- 2026-05-11T16:02Z — implemented ScriptData + escaped/double-escaped state family in `HtmlTokenizer.ScriptStates.cs`, wired dispatch/EOF handling, and added 6 focused tests. `dotnet test tests/Starling.Html.Tests/Starling.Html.Tests.csproj` passes 56/56; `dotnet test Starling.sln` passes in the worktree.
