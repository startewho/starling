# wp:M2-04 — TLS 1.3 transport

## Goal

Pure-managed TLS 1.3 client transport over the M2 TCP seam using
BouncyCastle. This package establishes the encrypted stream used by HTTP/1.1
and later HTTP/2.

## Outputs

- `src/Tessera.Net/Tls/*`
- `src/Tessera.Net/Resources/Roots/ccadb.pem`

## Acceptance

- TLS 1.3 handshake succeeds against `cloudflare.com` and `tls13.akamai.io`.
- SNI and ALPN (`h2`, then `http/1.1`) are advertised correctly.
- Certificate validation fails closed on a known-bad chain.
- No `SslStream`, `HttpClient`, P/Invoke, or native TLS dependency is used.

## Handoff log

- 2026-05-11T19:20Z — created after wp:M2-03-tcp completion; available to claim.
- 2026-05-11T19:24:07Z — claimed by agent-copilot-gpt-5.5, branch `wp-M2-04-tls`
