# wp:M3-06g2-shim-drawimage — fix ts_canvas_draw_image on Graphite canvases

## Goal

Follow-up to `wp:M3-06g`. The shim's `ts_canvas_draw_image`
(`native/shim/tessera_skia.cpp`, ~line 362) builds a raster `SkImage` via
`SkImages::RasterFromPixmapCopy` and calls `drawImageRect` — which is a **no-op
on a Graphite (GPU) canvas**: Graphite canvases only draw texture-backed
images. `wp:M3-06j` discovered this when it flipped the default backend to
Skia, and worked around it by pinning the three image-pixel tests in
`tests/Tessera.Paint.Tests` to the ImageSharp backend plus a skipped repro
test. This WP fixes the shim so images actually blit on the Skia backend, then
removes that workaround.

## Inputs

- `wp:M3-06g` complete: the shim + `native/shim/CMakeLists.txt` build
  `runtimes/osx-arm64/native/libtessera_skia.dylib`.
- `wp:M3-06j` complete: it left the workaround + a skipped `draw_image` repro
  smoke test in `tests/Tessera.Paint.Tests`.
- The native Skia checkout at `third_party/skia/` (headers — ground truth for
  the current Graphite image API).

## Outputs

- `native/shim/tessera_skia.cpp` — `ts_canvas_draw_image` uploads the raw RGBA
  pixels as a Graphite **texture-backed** `SkImage` (e.g.
  `SkImages::TextureFromImage(recorder, rasterImage, ...)` or the current
  Graphite equivalent — read the headers) before `drawImageRect`. The shim's
  `Recorder` is reachable from the context; thread it to the draw call if the
  `TsCanvas` handle doesn't already carry it.
- Rebuilt `runtimes/osx-arm64/native/libtessera_skia.dylib` (gitignored — not
  committed).
- `native/shim/smoke_test.c` — extend (or a sibling) to draw an image and read
  back the blitted pixels, asserting they match the source.
- `tests/Tessera.Paint.Tests/*` — revert the `wp:M3-06j` workaround: un-pin the
  three image-pixel tests from ImageSharp, un-skip the `draw_image` repro test,
  so they exercise the Skia backend and pass.

## Acceptance

- A `fill image → flush → read_pixels` round-trip through the shim returns the
  source image's pixels (C smoke test).
- The three `Tessera.Paint.Tests` image tests pass on the **default (Skia)**
  backend with the workaround removed.
- `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green from the repo root.
- `native/shim/CMakeLists.txt` link line unchanged (or, if a new lib is needed,
  documented in the handoff log).

## Notes

- Master plan: `~/.claude/plans/make-a-plan-to-serialized-boole.md` (Phase 2 /
  Phase 5 — the `DrawImage` display item).
- Graphite image upload API moved across Skia milestones — trust the headers in
  `third_party/skia/include/`, not API memory.
- osx-arm64 only until the win/linux native builds exist.

## Handoff log

- 2026-05-14T17:30:00Z — created (agent-claude-cody) as a follow-up after
  wp:M3-06j surfaced the no-op `ts_canvas_draw_image` on Graphite canvases.
