# wp:M3-06e-sslstream-tls — replace BouncyCastle TLS with `SslStream`

## Goal

Phase 9: swap the pure-managed BouncyCastle TLS engine for `SslStream` (OS TLS)
behind the **unchanged** `ITlsTransport` seam. `SslStream` is pure-managed BCL,
so `Tessera.Net` keeps its P/Invoke-free bill of health — no interop seam needed
here. Keep the bundled CCADB root store for cross-platform determinism, but
rebuild certificate verification on `System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates`.
Delete BouncyCastle entirely. Fully isolated to `Tessera.Net`; independently
mergeable to `main`.

## Inputs

- No code dependencies — fully isolated to `Tessera.Net`.
- Existing seam: `ITlsTransport.cs`, `TlsClientOptions.cs`, `TlsError.cs`,
  `TcpConnectionStream.cs`, embedded `ccadb.pem`.

## Outputs

- `src/Tessera.Net/Tls/SslStreamTlsTransport.cs` — implements `ITlsTransport`
  with `SslClientAuthenticationOptions`: ALPN (`Http2`, `Http11`), SNI
  (`TargetHost`), `EnabledSslProtocols = Tls13`.
- `src/Tessera.Net/Tls/CertificateVerifier.cs` — rewritten against
  `X509ChainPolicy.CustomTrustStore` + `TrustMode = CustomRootTrust` for chain
  building / expiry.
- `src/Tessera.Net/Tls/RootCertificates.cs` — rewritten to load the bundled
  CCADB roots as `X509Certificate2` for the custom trust store.
- Kept custom code: `CertificateHostNameMatcher` (SAN/wildcard matching only).
- **Deleted:** `src/Tessera.Net/Tls/BcTlsTransport.cs`,
  `TesseraTlsClient.cs`, `TesseraTlsAuthentication.cs`.
- **Kept:** `ITlsTransport.cs`, `TlsClientOptions.cs`, `TlsError.cs`,
  `TcpConnectionStream.cs`, embedded `ccadb.pem`.
- `src/Tessera.Net/TesseraHttpClient.cs` (~line 150) and
  `src/Tessera.Net/Http/PooledHttpTransport.cs` (type `_tls` as
  `ITlsTransport?`) — caller updates.
- `Directory.Packages.props` + `src/Tessera.Net/Tessera.Net.csproj` — remove
  `BouncyCastle.Cryptography`; regenerate affected `packages.lock.json`.

## Acceptance

- `SslStreamTlsTransport` implements the unchanged `ITlsTransport` seam; the
  `network-tests` job does a live TLS 1.3 + `h2` ALPN handshake to
  `example.com` / `nginx.org`.
- A bad certificate chain fails closed (custom trust store rejects it).
- `grep -rn BouncyCastle src/` is empty; `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` is gone
  from `Directory.Packages.props` and `Tessera.Net.csproj`; `packages.lock.json`
  regenerated.
- `BcTlsTransport.cs`, `TesseraTlsClient.cs`, `TesseraTlsAuthentication.cs` are
  deleted; the kept files remain.
- `Tessera.Net` stays P/Invoke-free (`SslStream` is BCL) — the interop-policy
  lint job still passes for this project with no allowlist entry.
- Full repo `dotnet test` green.

## Notes

- Master plan: `~/.claude/plans/make-a-plan-to-serialized-boole.md` (Phase 9).
- The `NoSslStream_InNetProject` test is **deleted** as part of `06l-ci-policy`
  — until then it will fail; coordinate the merge order via handoff log, or land
  the test deletion drive-by here if `06l` is not yet in flight.
- `Directory.Packages.props` is a merge-conflict hotspot — note the touch.

## Handoff log

- 2026-05-14T00:00:00Z — created (agent-claude-cody) during the native-interop pivot WP filing.
- 2026-05-14T14:52:00Z — completed (agent-claude-cody-tls). Landed:
  - `Tls/SslStreamTlsTransport.cs` (new) — `ITlsTransport` over `SslStream`,
    `SslClientAuthenticationOptions` with ALPN (`h2`/`http/1.1`), SNI
    (`TargetHost`), `EnabledSslProtocols = Tls13`. Cert validation routed
    through a `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` → `CertificateVerifier`
    (OS trust store never consulted). Returns `CertificateRejected` vs.
    `HandshakeFailed` via a callback-set flag.
  - `Tls/CertificateVerifier.cs` — rewritten on `X509Chain` +
    `X509ChainPolicy.CustomTrustStore` + `TrustMode = CustomRootTrust`;
    `CertificateHostNameMatcher` kept (SAN DNS + RFC 6125 wildcard).
  - `Tls/RootCertificates.cs` — embedded `ccadb.pem` →
    `X509Certificate2Collection` via `ImportFromPem`.
  - Deleted `BcTlsTransport.cs`, `TesseraTlsClient.cs`,
    `TesseraTlsAuthentication.cs`.
  - Callers: `TesseraHttpClient.cs` dials `SslStreamTlsTransport`;
    `PooledHttpTransport._tls` typed `ITlsTransport?`.
  - `Directory.Packages.props` + `Tessera.Net.csproj` — `BouncyCastle.Cryptography`
    removed (note: `Directory.Packages.props` touched — merge hotspot).
  - `tests/Tessera.Net.Tests/Tls/TlsClientTests.cs` rewritten against
    `X509Certificate2` / `SslStreamTlsTransport` (drive-by — required to keep
    the build green once BC types were deleted). Added a custom-trust-anchor
    acceptance test and a hostname-mismatch rejection test. Live test now
    targets `example.com` / `nginx.org`, gated on `TESSERA_ALLOW_NETWORK=1`.
  - No `packages.lock.json` files exist in the repo — nothing to regenerate.
  - No `NoSslStream_InNetProject` test exists in the tree — nothing to delete.
  - **Caveat — live TLS could not be verified locally.** On this macOS dev box,
    `SslStream` throws `PlatformNotSupportedException` when `SslProtocols.Tls13`
    is pinned (SecureTransport limitation). With `SslProtocols.None` the same
    code negotiated TLS 1.2 + ALPN `h2` against `cloudflare.com` successfully,
    and the cert callback received a full 3-element chain — so the transport
    wiring is sound. The `Tls13` pin is kept per the WP contract; the Linux CI
    `network-tests` runner (OpenSSL) is where live TLS 1.3 + `h2` is exercised.
  - `dotnet test tests/Tessera.Net.Tests` → 157/157 green.
  - `grep -rn BouncyCastle src/ --include='*.cs'` is empty (only stale
    `bin/obj` build artifacts in unrelated projects still mention it).
- 2026-05-19T02:55Z — superseded by wp:M5-skia-removal (commit 7b7ebd0): the Skia/Graphite native shim was removed from the engine and ImageSharp.Drawing 3 became the sole paint backend. This WP is left in place as history.
