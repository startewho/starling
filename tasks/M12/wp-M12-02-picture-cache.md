# wp:M12-02-picture-cache — Single-bitmap picture cache (WebRender-style)

## Goal

Avoid re-painting from scratch on every scroll by caching the most recent
viewport raster keyed by `(page-version, scale, page-coord origin)`. On a
scroll where the new viewport is fully covered by the cached image, blit
the cached pixels at an offset instead of re-running the paint backend.
On a scroll where part of the new viewport extends beyond the cache, paint
only the newly-exposed strip (delta-paint) and stitch it onto the existing
cache.

This is intentionally *one* bitmap, not a tile grid — that comes in
`wp:M12-05-tile-grid`. The picture cache buys back the scroll smoothness
lost when `wp:M12-01-viewport-clip` removed the "render the whole page
once" approach.

## Inputs

- `wp:M12-01-viewport-clip` shipped: `IPaintBackend.Render` takes a
  viewport, `WebviewPanel` re-renders on scroll.
- A way to invalidate the cache when the display list changes — for now,
  a monotonically increasing `Page.DisplayListVersion` bumped whenever
  layout or style recomputes. Style/layout already runs on the UI thread;
  bumping a counter is cheap.

## Outputs

- New `Starling.Paint.PictureCache`:
  - Holds the last rendered `RenderedBitmap`, its page-coord origin, its
    scale, and the `pageVersion` it was rendered against.
  - `TryServe(viewport, scale, pageVersion, out blit)` returns a hit when
    `viewport ⊆ cached.Bounds` and the version + scale match.
  - `Stitch(strip)` accepts a newly-painted edge strip and grows the cache
    bitmap, evicting if it would exceed a configurable max area
    (e.g. 2× window size).
- `PageRendererHost` (or a new `CachedPageRenderer`) consults the cache
  before invoking the backend, splits the requested viewport into "cache
  hit" + "uncached strips" rectangles, paints the strips through the
  backend, and composites the result.
- A diagnostics counter set: `paint.cache.hit`, `paint.cache.miss`,
  `paint.cache.partial`, `paint.cache.evict`. Histogram of strip area
  painted per frame.

## Acceptance

- A test that scrolls a synthetic 200000-px page by 50 px N times records
  ≥ N-1 `paint.cache.partial` hits and ≤ 1 full miss. Strip area painted
  per scroll is ≤ `50 × viewport.Width` (plus the overdraw margin).
- A test that bumps `DisplayListVersion` between frames records a full
  cache miss on the next render.
- Scrolling netclaw.dev feels smooth (manual smoke; documented in the
  handoff log) and `paint.cache.hit` dominates `paint.cache.miss` in the
  Aspire dashboard.
- `dotnet build && dotnet test` green.

## Notes

- The cache is per-tab. Switching tabs throws the cache away; a future
  enhancement can hold N tab caches with LRU eviction.
- Subpixel scrolling: strips are painted at integer page-coord offsets
  but composited at the requested float offset; the inner stitching code
  rounds to whole device pixels to avoid aliasing.
- This WP does NOT touch CSS animations or hover styles — any change to
  the display list bumps `pageVersion` and invalidates wholesale. Smarter
  partial invalidation lands with `wp:M12-06-invalidation`.
- Reuses `RenderedBitmap` storage; the cache is a single managed
  `byte[]` plus a `Rectangle` describing its page-coord placement.
