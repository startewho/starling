# wp:M12-12-webgpu-scene-cache — Retained-scene caching for the WebGPU backend

## Goal

Encode a page's display list into a Vello retained scene once
(`DrawingCanvas.CreateScene`) and replay it with `DrawingCanvas.RenderScene` on
subsequent frames, so an unchanged display list skips the per-frame CPU
scene-encoding cost. This is the WebGPU analogue of the CPU glyph atlas
(`wp:M12-11`) — the right lever for the **default** backend, which the atlas does
not help.

## Why this exists (Phase 0.5 spike findings)

The WebGPU package is a Vello-style scene renderer. A spike
(`GlyphAtlasSpike`) showed its per-frame `command_record` cost is dominated by
**CPU-side scene encoding** of glyph runs (~26µs/glyph), not glyph
rasterization — so a glyph atlas gives it no benefit (≈0.93×).

A follow-up spike (`SceneCacheSpike`, throwaway, since removed) measured the
retained-scene API instead:

- **Same-target (device fixed):** draw-each-frame `21.97 ms` → `RenderScene`
  replay `3.25 ms` = **6.76×**. The replayed frame is correct (non-blank
  readback), so replay genuinely reproduces the content.
- **Cross-target:** a scene built on one `WebGPURenderTarget` replays on a
  **fresh** target — draw `24.81 ms` → replay `4.53 ms` = **5.48×**. This
  matters because `ImageSharpBackend.RenderWebGpu` allocates a new target per
  render; the scene survives that boundary.

So `RenderScene` skips re-encoding and is ~5–7× cheaper than re-issuing the
draw commands, and it works across the per-frame target lifecycle.

## Where it pays off

The sliding-window picture cache (shipped) already serves unchanged *pixels*
with no backend call, so this WP targets the cases that still hit the backend:

- **Scroll / arbitrary viewport from one encode.** Encode the whole page's
  display list into a retained scene once per display-list version, then each
  frame `RenderScene` it under a viewport-translate transform for the current
  scroll offset — replay cost (~3–5 ms) regardless of how much text is visible,
  instead of re-encoding the visible glyphs every strip/MISS.
- **MISS reseed + overlays.** A picture-cache MISS, hover/selection repaint, or
  animation frame on unchanged content replays the cached scene.

## Key open questions (spike before building)

1. **Transform at replay.** Can a viewport/scroll offset be applied at replay
   time (`canvas.Save(translate); canvas.RenderScene(scene); canvas.Restore();`)
   and does it compose with the scene's own transforms? Needed to render
   different scroll offsets from one encoded scene. (The same-target/cross-target
   spike replayed at the original transform only.)
2. **Scene lifetime / memory.** `DrawingBackendScene` holds owned GPU resources;
   size per page, eviction, and disposal on version bump / navigation.
3. **Device/target reuse.** Cross-target replay works, but each
   `new WebGPURenderTarget` still pays ~15 ms device/context init. Real gains
   need the device (and ideally target) reused across frames — relate to
   `wp:M12-07-compositor-thread` / `wp:M12-10-render-on-demand`.
4. **Invalidation granularity.** Re-encode on display-list version bump
   (`LaidOutPage.DisplayListVersion`); confirm partial invalidation
   (`wp:M12-06`) interplay.

## Acceptance

- WebGPU re-render of an unchanged display list at a new viewport drops to
  replay cost (target: ≥4× vs re-encode on a text-heavy page).
- Output stays ≥ 0.99 SSIM vs the re-encode path; `PictureCacheTests`
  byte-identical guarantee unaffected (cache sits below the picture cache).
- New bench capturing encode-once / replay-many.

## Out of scope

- CPU backend (use `wp:M12-11` glyph atlas there).
- Tile grid / partial invalidation (separate WPs).
