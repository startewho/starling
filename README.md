# Tessera

Managed-first .NET 10 web browser. Built from primitives, no Chromium / Gecko / WebKit reuse.
Native interop is confined to two vetted seams (graphics + image codecs); everything
else is pure-managed.

> **Status:** M1 static rendering is wired end-to-end for the current supported
> subset: HTML tokenizer/tree-builder, DOM, CSS cascade, block/inline layout,
> display-list paint, and PNG output. M2 networking pieces through HTTP/1 are
> present, with redirects, meta charset sniffing, local HTTP render fixtures,
> session cookies, navigation history, a deterministic event-loop core, and a
> tiny JS-to-DOM host bridge; the next large section is live/snapshot web-page
> rendering plus images. See
> [`browser-plan/13_MILESTONES.md`](browser-plan/13_MILESTONES.md) for the roadmap.

## Quickstart

Requires the [.NET SDK 10.0.100](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) or newer.

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test

# Render the static 'hello world' fixture (bare path is auto-normalized to file://)
dotnet run --project src/Tessera.Headless -- render testdata/hello.html -o out.png
```

> **Native shim required.** Skia Graphite is the engine's sole rasterizer —
> there is no managed fallback. The native `libtessera_skia` shim is gitignored
> and not committed, so on a fresh checkout `dotnet build` fails fast with an
> actionable error until you build it. See
> [`native/README.md`](native/README.md) for the two-step build
> (`./native/build-skia.sh` then the shim CMake build). Currently produced for
> osx-arm64 only.

The CLI accepts bare filesystem paths as well as well-formed `file://` URLs.
`file:///absolute/path` works; `file://relative` does not (per the WHATWG URL
spec, the segment after `//` is the authority/host, not part of the path).

The CLI's full shape is documented in [`browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md`](browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md#headless-cli-shape).
Subcommands beyond `render` and `tokenize` are still incremental and may return a
"not yet implemented" message as they light up over the remaining milestones.

## Interop policy

**Managed-first, native at vetted seams.** Native interop (`LibraryImport`) is
confined to two designated projects — `Tessera.Skia` (graphics) and
`Tessera.Codecs` (image decode). Every other engine project stays P/Invoke-free and
takes no native dependency beyond what the .NET BCL ships. The CI `lint` job greps
the engine-project allowlist (all engine projects *except* the two interop projects)
to enforce this — see
[`02_PROJECT_SETUP.md`](browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md#ci-matrix-githubworkflowsciyml).

## Working on Tessera

Each subsystem has a focused doc in [`browser-plan/`](browser-plan/). For agent-facing work
packages with explicit inputs / outputs / acceptance, see
[`14_AGENT_TASKS.md`](browser-plan/14_AGENT_TASKS.md).

**Implementation agents:** start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the queue at
[`tasks/INDEX.md`](tasks/INDEX.md). Multiple agents can work in parallel — claim
an unblocked package via `./tasks/lib/claim.sh`, work on the dedicated branch,
leave a handoff-log entry on stop, and complete when merged. The full workflow
is in [`tasks/README.md`](tasks/README.md).

## License

TBD (set before public release).
