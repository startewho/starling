# Starling

Managed-first .NET 10 web browser. Built from primitives, no Chromium / Gecko / WebKit reuse.
Native interop is confined to one vetted seam (image codecs); everything
else — including paint — is pure-managed.

## Status — high-level buckets

Legend: ✅ shipped · 🟡 partial / actively iterating · ⚫ not started

| Bucket | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **HTML parsing** | ✅ | Tokenizer (html5lib 100%) + spec-compliant tree builder. |
| **DOM** | ✅ | Nodes, mutations, live collections, events. |
| **CSS** | 🟡 | Tokenizer, parser, selectors (incl. `:has`, pseudo-elements, modern pseudo-classes), cascade + layers, Values 4 math (`calc`/`min`/`max`/`clamp`), Color 4 spaces + gamut mapping, Media 5 + `@supports`, CSS Nesting, `revert`/`unset`, `@font-face` + WOFF/WOFF2, 207 PropertyIds. Further property/feature coverage ongoing. |
| **Layout** | 🟡 | Block + inline + inline-block (with BFC for block children and two-pass max-content shrink-to-fit), margin collapse, `margin: auto` centering, text-align, minimal table layout via UA-stylesheet inline-block cells, form controls visible by default. Flex/grid not yet. |
| **Paint** | ✅ | ImageSharp.Drawing 3 (pure-managed, SixLabors licensed via repo-root `sixlabors.lic`). DisplayList drives both headless and GUI. WebGPU compute target is the default; opt back to the CPU path with `STARLING_PAINT_BACKEND=imagesharp`. |
| **Networking** | ✅ | URL (WPT 100%), DNS, TCP, **TLS 1.3 via BouncyCastle** (an `SslStream` migration was reverted in `939f3a5` after a macOS TLS 1.3 issue — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), HTTP/1.1 with keep-alive connection pool, gzip/brotli/deflate, redirects, RFC 6265bis cookies + PSL, WHATWG encoding labels (43/43 curated WPT subset), CCADB root store. `starling render https://example.com` is gated in CI. |
| **Image pipeline** | ✅ | OS-native codecs (`Starling.Codecs`: ImageIO on macOS, WIC on Windows, libjpeg/png/webp on Linux), `data:` URI support, accessible names for unrenderable `<img>`/`<svg>`. |
| **JS engine** | 🟡 | Lex + parse + bytecode compiler + register VM; functions, recursion, snapshot closures, `new`/`this`, method binding. Still ahead: intrinsics (Object/Array/String/Number/Math/JSON/Date/RegExp), Promise + microtasks, ES modules, async/await, destructuring, classes, Test262 ≥ 80%. **The single largest gating piece for interactive demos.** |
| **DOM bindings / Web APIs** | ⚫ | Blocked on JS intrinsics. A temporary `DomBindingHost` exists for read/update + click dispatch experiments. |
| **GUI shell** | 🟡 | Avalonia 12 (desktop: win/mac/linux). Chrome (Sidebar, UrlBar, StatusBar, WebviewPanel, Favicon, MiniLoadChart), DevTools panels (Console, Performance, Internals), `BrowserSession` (shared cookies + nav history across tabs), an in-process MCP server (`GuiMcpServer`) exposing browser-control tools to external agents. See [`src/Starling.Gui/`](src/Starling.Gui/). |
| **Telemetry / Aspire** | ✅ | Aspire AppHost orchestrates Gui + Headless; shared OTel + health-check bootstrap. |
| **Multi-process / sandbox / disk cache / HSTS** | ⚫ | M9+, not started. |

milestone-by-milestone roadmap and [`tasks/INDEX.md`](tasks/INDEX.md) for the
work-package queue.

## Quickstart

Requires the [.NET SDK 10.0.100](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) or newer.

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test

# Render the static 'hello world' fixture (bare path is auto-normalized to file://)
dotnet run --project src/Starling.Headless -- render testdata/hello.html -o out.png
# The built CLI binary is named `starling`.
```

> **Pure-managed paint.** The engine paints via ImageSharp.Drawing 3 — no
> native graphics shim to build. The SixLabors stack requires a license key,
> picked up from the repo-root `sixlabors.lic` automatically.

The CLI accepts bare filesystem paths as well as well-formed `file://` URLs.
`file:///absolute/path` works; `file://relative` does not (per the WHATWG URL
spec, the segment after `//` is the authority/host, not part of the path).

The CLI's full shape is documented in [`browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md`](browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md#headless-cli-shape).
Subcommands beyond `render` and `tokenize` are still incremental and may return a
"not yet implemented" message as they light up over the remaining milestones.

```

## Interop policy

**Managed-first, native at vetted seams.** Native interop (`LibraryImport`) is
confined to one designated project — `Starling.Codecs` (image decode). Every
other engine project stays P/Invoke-free and takes no native dependency beyond
what the .NET BCL ships. The CI `lint` job greps the engine-project allowlist
(all engine projects *except* the Codecs interop project) to enforce this — see
[`02_PROJECT_SETUP.md`](browser-plan/02_PROJECT_SETUP.md#ci-matrix-githubworkflowsciyml).

## Working on Starling

Each subsystem has a focused doc in [`browser-plan/`](browser-plan/). For agent-facing work
packages with explicit inputs / outputs / acceptance, see
[`14_AGENT_TASKS.md`](browser-plan/14_AGENT_TASKS.md).

**Implementation agents:** start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the queue at
[`tasks/INDEX.md`](tasks/INDEX.md). Multiple agents can work in parallel — claim
an unblocked package via `./tasks/lib/claim.sh`, commit directly to `main` with
the wp id in the subject, leave a handoff-log entry on stop, and mark complete
via `./tasks/lib/claim.sh complete <wp-id>`. The full workflow is in
[`tasks/README.md`](tasks/README.md).

## License

TBD (set before public release).
