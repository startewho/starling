/// The live JavaScript context retained for an interactively-loaded page so the

/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>dispatch DOM events (input/change/focus/keydown/…) into page listeners
/// via <see cref="DispatchEvent"/>, so forms and search-as-you-type handlers
/// run; and</item>
/// <item>pump the page's event loop — microtasks, <c>setTimeout</c>/<c>setInterval</c>,
/// <c>requestAnimationFrame</c>, and <c>fetch</c>/XHR completions — against real
/// wall-clock time via <see cref="PumpFrame"/>.</item>
/// </list>
/// Owned by the <see cref="LaidOutPage"/> and disposed with it (tearing down the
/// JS HTTP client, the script fetcher, and the realm's DOM hooks). On a relayout
/// (resize / form edit) the owning page transfers this object to its successor,
/// so the same live realm survives reflows.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The live realm is reached only through the <see cref="IScriptSession"/> seam
/// to the Starling JS engine, which owns the realm, the simulated loop, and the
/// dynamic-script runner; this host just routes the shell's post-load events and
/// pump ticks into it.
/// </remarks>
/// <remarks>
/// Single-threaded: every method must run on the shell's UI thread. The realm is
/// not thread-safe; the load-time async phase has fully settled before the page
/// (and this host) is handed to the shell, after which only the UI thread touches
/// the realm. Off-thread <c>fetch</c>/XHR completions enqueue resolve jobs onto
/// the realm's (thread-safe) microtask queue, which <see cref="PumpFrame"/> drains.
