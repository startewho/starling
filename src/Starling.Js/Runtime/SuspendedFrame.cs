/// B1b-2c — runtime handle for a generator / async function body suspended
/// at a <c>yield</c> or <c>await</c> point. Backed by a dedicated worker
/// thread that owns the VM frame's locals + eval stack: when JS code on the
/// main thread calls <c>.next()</c> (generator) or the awaited promise
/// settles (async), the main thread signals the worker to resume and waits
/// for the next suspension or completion.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The handoff is synchronous: only one thread runs JS at a time, so the
/// usual single-threaded VM invariants are preserved. The worker thread
/// blocks on <see cref="_resume"/> until the main thread sets it; the main
/// thread blocks on <see cref="_yield"/> until the worker yields. There is
/// no lock — the events provide mutual exclusion.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Chosen for implementation simplicity over CPS rewriting. Performance
/// cost: one thread per concurrently-suspended generator/async, plus the
/// signal cost on each yield. Acceptable for the M3 surface.
