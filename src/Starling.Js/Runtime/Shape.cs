/// A hidden class ("shape") for the fast-path storage of an ordinary object's
/// <em>string-keyed data properties</em>. Shapes form a transition tree rooted
/// at <see cref="Root"/>: adding a property transitions to a child shape that is
/// cached on the parent, so two objects that gain the same properties (same
/// keys, same order, same attributes) end up sharing the <em>same</em> Shape
/// instance. That shared identity is what makes an inline cache's
/// <c>ReferenceEquals(obj.Shape, cachedShape)</c> check meaningful across many
/// objects.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Scope is deliberately narrow. A Shape describes only string-keyed DATA
/// properties. Accessors, deletion, attribute redefinition, sealing/freezing,
/// and non-extensible adds all push the object into "dictionary mode"
/// (<c>JsObject</c> with a null shape), where the legacy dictionary storage runs
/// unchanged. Symbol-keyed properties never enter a shape. This keeps the fast
/// path small and the intricate spec validators untouched.</para>
/// <para>Each data property occupies exactly one slot in the object's slot
/// array; the slot index equals the property's position in creation order
/// (<see cref="AddedSlot"/>). Slot indices are stable across the transition
/// tree — a child never moves a parent's slots — so a cached (shape, slot) pair
/// stays valid for the life of that shape.</para>
/// <para><b>Thread-safety.</b> Shapes can be shared across host callbacks and
/// realms. The lazily-built transition cache and flattened lookup table are
/// guarded by <see cref="_gate"/>; the immutable per-shape data (parent, key,
/// flags, slot count) needs no lock. Inline-cache hot reads never touch a
/// Shape's mutable state — they only compare references and index the object's
/// slot array.</para>

    // The flattened table is only a lookup accelerator; the transition chain
    // itself is the source of truth. Flattening eagerly on first lookup was
    // the engine's single largest retained-memory cost (x.com at peak: 251 MB
    // of Dictionary<string,ShapeProp> entries — 39% of the managed heap —
    // across ~36k shapes), because every looked-up shape copied its parent's
    // whole table: a chain of N properties materialized N tables of sizes
    // 1..N. A shape now flattens only when it is BOTH deep and warm:
    //  - SlotCount <= FlattenSlotThreshold: never flatten. Walking <= 8
    //    parent links (one reference load + ordinal compare each) costs about
    //    the same as a single dictionary probe, and small shapes are the
    //    overwhelming majority.
    //  - Deeper shapes flatten once their lookup count reaches their own
    //    depth, min(SlotCount, FlattenLookupCap). Scaling the threshold with
    //    depth makes the table cost-proportional: a table of N entries is only
    //    built after ~N lookups' worth of chain-walk work, so a shape that is
    //    grown and read a handful of times per property (the React/spread
    //    pattern — each intermediate shape of a growing object sees ~2-4
    //    lookups, regardless of depth) never flattens, while a shape that
    //    keeps fielding lookups pays the one-time flatten and from then on
    //    behaves exactly like the old always-flattened code. The cap bounds
    //    the pre-flatten walk work for very wide objects (a 10k-slot shape
    //    flattens after 256 lookups, not 10k).
