/// Concrete <see cref="IHttpTransport"/> wrapping a TCP connection optionally

/// present) <see cref="ITlsTransport"/>; <see cref="DisposeAsync"/> tears
/// everything down so the same wrapper can never be used twice after a close.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The <see cref="Stream"/> exposed to the HTTP layer is the TLS-wrapped
/// stream for HTTPS or a thin <see cref="TcpConnectionStream"/> adapter for
/// plain HTTP. Either way, reads/writes go through one byte-oriented stream
/// so the request writer and response parser remain transport-agnostic.
